Welcome to Mini Kickstarter!

Before starting, run `pip install requirements.txt` for setup.
To run the program, type `python minikickstarter.py`

To run some nose tests, type `nose kickstarter_tests.py` from the top-level directory.

I wrote Mini Kickstarter in Python mostly because I really enjoy working in it!
This application uses the python Cmd module to create a command line interface.


To allow the data to persist locally, I set up a Sqlite database, but for
a 'real' application it would need something more heavy-duty on an external server.
